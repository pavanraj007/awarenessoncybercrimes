            <h1><br>WHAT IS CYBER CRIME?</h1>
            <h2><br>INTRODUCTION<br></h2>
            <p1 class="par"><br>"Cyber" is a prefix used to describe a person, thing, or idea as part of the
                computer and information age. Taken from kybernetes, Greek word for
                "steersman" or "governor," it was first used in cybernetics, a word coined by
                Norbert Wiener and his colleagues. The virtual world of internet is known as
                cyberspace and the laws governing this area are known as Cyber laws and all
                the netizens of this space come under the ambit of these laws as it carries a
                kind of universal jurisdiction. Cyber law can also be described as that branch
                of law that deals with legal issues related to use of inter-networked information
                technology. In short, cyber law is the law governing computers and the
                internet.</p1>
                <h2><br>CYBER CRIMES / CYBER FRAUDS</h2>
                <p2 class="par"><br>The Internet has become a basic fact of everyday life for millions of people
                    worldwide, from e-mail to online shopping. Ever faster and more accessible
                    connections available on a wider range of platforms, such as mobile phones or
                    person to person portable devices, have spurred new e-commerce
                    opportunities. Online shopping and banking are increasingly widespread and
                    over the next 10 years, the Net is expected to become as common as gas or
                    electricity. The invention of the computers has opened new avenues for the
                    fraudsters. It is an evil having its origin in the growing dependence on
                    computers in modern life.
                    Fraud is the intentional deception of a person or group for the purpose of
                    stealing property or money. Internet fraud includes any scheme using Web
                    sites, chat rooms, and email to offer nonexistent goods and services to
                    consumers or to communicate false information to consumers. Customers then
                    pay for the fraudulent goods over the Internet with their credit cards. Internet
                    fraud involves a wide variety of schemes limited only by the imagination and
                    creativity of a seller intent on deceiving a buyer. A few general characteristics
                    one can find in all cyber scams. Most scams are done by e-mail. They entice
                    users to give them critical information like usernames, passwords, credit card
                    information, or other types of account information.
                    Cyber fraud has the potential of hindering the economic and social
                    development of any nation. This is because among other dire consequences,
                    foreign investment is seriously discouraged. Cyber fraud can also destroy our
                    good and morally sound culture. This is because the youth will no longer work
                    but resort to that means to earn their living.</p2>
                    <h2><br>DEFINITION OF CYBER CRIME</h2>
                    <p3 class="par"><br>At the Tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and
                        Treatment of Offenders, in a workshop devoted to the issues of crimes related
                        to computer networks, cybercrime was broken into two categories and defined
                        thus:
                        a. Cybercrime in a narrow sense (computer crime): Any illegal behavior
                        directed by means of electronic operations that targets the security of
                        computer systems and the data processed by them.
                        b. Cybercrime in a broader sense (computer-related crime): Any illegal
                        behavior committed by means of, or in relation to, a computer system or
                        network, including such crimes as illegal possession [and] offering or
                        distributing information by means of a computer system or network.
                        The OECD Recommendations of 1986 included a working definition as a basis
                        for the study: Computer-related crime is considered as any illegal, unethical or
                        unauthorized behaviour relating to the automatic processing and the
                        transmission of data.<br><br></p3>
