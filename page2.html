<div id="ONLINE FRAUDS" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>ONLINE FRAUDS</h3>
  <h4>Online Job Fraud</h4>
  <p>Online Job Fraud is an attempt to defraud people who are in need of employment by giving them false hope/ promise of better employment with higher wages.</p>
<h4> Email Scam</h4>
<p>It is a method used by fraudsters to steal your personal information.
    Under this fraud, fraudsters send you emails by posing as a genuine or reputed company.
     The primary intention of sending those emails is to steal your bank details. 
      These emails usually will have a link or attachment.
       If you click on those links, you will be taken to a fake website.
       The fake website will ask you to provide your sensitive information like card details, UPI code and other bank details. Also, clicking on such links will lead to a virus attack on your computer.
</p>
<h4>Online shopping frauds</h4>
<p>It is one of the biggest internet frauds since the past few years.
   Under this, fraudsters set up fake online shopping portals with the intention of cheating innocent people of their hard-earned money.
    In the website, they display attractive product at a very cheap rate.
     But, after the purchase is made by paying the money, either the fake product is delivered or the product is not delivered at all.
   These websites will not have any return or refund policies and also there will be no customer support team to contact. </p>
   <h4>Work from home scam</h4>
   <p>Work from home scam is one of the serious internet fraud. Under this, fraudsters dupe people who are looking for work from home opportunities by promising that they will earn handsome money, just by working for a few hours from home. To register for the scheme, job seekers will be asked to deposit a certain amount of money for job kit which is useful for the work. After the money is deposited, there will be no track of employers.</p>
   <h4>Lottery fraud</h4>
   <p>Lottery fraud is one among the top three internet frauds in India. Under lottery fraud, fraudsters call you or send emails and messages stating you have won a lottery worth rupees some crore. To receive the lottery money, you will be asked to transfer money online in the name of tax.  Sometimes you will be asked to pay money by visiting fake websites. When you try to make payment using those websites, all your card details will be stolen.</p>
   <h4>Matrimonial frauds</h4>
   <p>In this busy lifestyle, people prefer online matrimonial sites to find their life partners. But, the sad part here is a lot of people lose lakhs of money while finding their soulmates on the matrimonial sites. Fraudsters dupe innocent people by creating fake profiles. Also, there are many gangs set up to carry out this fraud. Under this fraud, first, fraudsters make victims believe them. Once the trust is created, money is looted from the victims.</p>
   <h4>Credit card reward point fraud</h4>
   <p>Reward points or loyalty points are offered by the credit card companies to promote the usage of a credit card. Frauds are also taken place in the name of credit card reward point. Fraudsters call credit cardholders claiming to be from their credit card company and tell them that they would help them in redeeming their credit card reward point. They create urgency among cardholders stating offer will end very soon. To redeem the reward points, cardholders will be asked to provide their card details along with OTP. Fraudsters carry out fraudulent transactions using these details. </p>
   <h4> Frauds on OLX</h4>
   <p>Frauds on OLX have become very common and many people have lost their money while buying and selling products on the website. The fraud which normally takes place on OLX is, fraudsters pose as Army personnel and post their advertisement on the website.  Fraudsters use the stolen Id card of army personnel to make people trust them. They collect money from the buyer for the advertised product but they will never deliver the product. Here goodwill associated with the armed forces is used by fraudsters to cheat people of their hard-earned money.</p>
   <h4> Social media frauds</h4>
   <p>With the number of people using social media, social media frauds are on the rise. Cyberbullying is one of the biggest social media fraud to which many teenagers have fallen prey. Under cyberbullying social media sites are used to bully people. Also, there are many other social media frauds like a Facebook friend fraud.</p>
   <h4>PRECAUTIONS</h4>
   <p>1.Keep your computers and mobile devices up to date. Having the latest security software, web browser, and operating system are the best defenses against viruses, malware, and other online threats. Turn on automatic updates so you receive the newest fixes as they become available.
    <br>2.Set strong passwords. A strong password is at least eight characters in length and includes a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    <br>3. Do not click on links or open any attachments or pop-up screens from sources you are not familiar with.
    <br>4.Keep personal information personal. Hackers can use social media profiles to figure out your passwords and answer those security questions in the password reset tools. Lock down your privacy settings and avoid posting things like birthdays, addresses, mother’s maiden name, etc. Be wary of requests to connect from people you do not know.
    <br>5.Secure your internet connection. Always protect your home wireless network with a password. When connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, be cautious about what information you are sending over it.
    <br>6.Shop safely. Before shopping online, make sure the website uses secure technology. When you are at the checkout screen, verify that the web address begins with https. Also, check to see if a tiny locked padlock symbol appears on the page.
    <br>7.Read the site’s privacy policies. Though long and complex, privacy policies tell you how the site protects the personal information it collects. If you don’t see or understand a site’s privacy policy, consider doing business elsewhere.

<div id="INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CRIMES" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CRIMES</h3>
  <p>With the growth in the use of internet these days the cyber crimes are also growing. Cyber theft of Intellectual Property(IP) is one of them. Cyber theft of IP means stealing of copyrights, trade secrets, patents etc., using internet and computers.
    <br><br>Earlier, a lot of physical labour, time and money was spent to steal a trade secret or make a pirated version of anything. The original copies had to be physically stolen which used to take lot of time and money. But in the present scenario these works can be done easily sitting at one place without shedding too much time and money on it without leaving any proof of it.
    <br><br>The country has started taking strict measures to curb this offence. <span><b>Telangana Intellectual Property Crime Unit (TIPCU) is one of the first unit that has been launched to deal with the IP crime.</b></span>
  </p>
  <h4>REAL TIME CASE STUDY</h4>
  <p>Indiaforensic Research Foundation have conducted a survey on the cybersquatting in Indian Nationalised banks and have found that 22% of the domain names of Indian nationalized banks have been squatted. In addition to that Satyam Vs. Siffy is the most widely known case. Bharti Cellular Ltd. filed a case in the Delhi High Court that some cyber squatters had registered domain names such as bharticellular.com and bhartimobile.com with Network solutions under different fictitious names. The court directed Network Solutions not to transfer the domain names in question to any third party and the matter is sub-judice. Similar issues had risen before various High Courts earlier. Yahoo had sued one Akash Arora for use of the domain name ‘Yahooindia.Com’ deceptively similar to its ‘Yahoo.com’. As this case was governed by the Trade Marks Act, 1958, the additional defence taken against Yahoo’s legal action for the interim order was that the Trade Marks Act was applicable only to goods.</p>
  <h4>PRECAUTIONS</h4>
  <p><b>Some of the ways through which one can protect IP from cyber theft are:</b> 
    <br>1. Frequently updating the list of IPs' that need to be secured.<br>
  2. The company can increase the security to access its trade secrets.<br>
  3. It can reduce the number of people who can access their trade secrets.<br>
  4. Company needs to be up to date with software systems.<br>
  5. Constantly checking for some unusual cyber activities.<br>
  6. Constantly educate their employees about cyber security.<br>
  7. Constructing some threat mitigating programmes.<br>
  8. Installing up-to date anti-virus software.<br>
  9. Allowing employees to reach only some classified data.
  <br><br>Even after taking all these steps to protect IP's there is no guarantee that they cannot be stolen because human dependence on the internet is growing constantly and people come up with new ways to do even a small thing so even in this case these cyber thieves may come up with new ways to crack all these security systems.</p>

<div id="SALE OF ILLEGAL ARTICLES" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>SALE OF ILLEGAL ARTICLES</h3>
  <p>This would include sale of narcotics, weapons and wildlife etc., by posting information on websites, auction websites, and bulletin boards or simply by using email communication. E.g. many of the auction sites even in India are believed to be selling cocaine in the name of ‘honey’. The clip of the DPS students was kept for selling on the site called Bazee.com by a student from IIT Kharagpur.</p>
</div>
<div id="EMAIL SPOOFING" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>EMAIL SPOOFING</h3>
    <p>Email spoofing is a technique used in spam and phishing attacks to trick users into thinking a message came from a person or entity they either know or can trust. In spoofing attacks, the sender forges email headers so that client software displays the fraudulent sender address, which most users take at face value. Unless they inspect the header more closely, users see the forged sender in a message. If it’s a name they recognize, they’re more likely to trust it. So they’ll click malicious links, open malware attachments, send sensitive data and even wire corporate funds.
    </p>
    <h4>REAL TIME CASE STUDY</h4>
    <p>Email spoofing has been responsible for public incidents with serious business and financial consequences. This was the case in an October 2013 email to a news agency which was spoofed to look as if it was from the Swedish company Fingerprint Cards. The email stated that Samsung offered to purchase the company. The news spread and the stock exchange rate surged by 50%.
      <br><br>Malware such as Klez and Sober among many more modern examples often search for email addresses within the computer they have infected, and they use those addresses both as targets for email, and also to create credible forged From fields in the emails that they send. This is to ensure that the emails are more likely to be opened. For example:
      <br>1. Alice is sent an infected email which she opens, running the worm code.
      <br>2. The worm code searches Alice's email address book and finds the addresses of Bob and Charlie.
      <br>3. From Alice's computer, the worm sends an infected email to Bob, but is forged to appear as if it was sent by Charlie.
    </p>
    <h4>PRECAUTIONS</h4>
    <p>1. Deploy an email security gateway
      <br>2. Use antimalware software<br>3. Use encryption to protect emails<br>4. Use email security protocols<br>5. Use reverse IP lookups to authenticate senders
      <br>6. Never give out personal information<br>7. Avoid strange attachments or unfamiliar links
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div id="FORGERY" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>FORGERY</h3>
    <p>Forgery is the creation of a document which one knows is not genuine and yet projects the same as if it is genuine. In common parlance, it is used more in terms of affixing somebody else's signature on a document. Digital forgery implies making use of digital technology to forge a document, desktop publishing systems, color laser and ink-jet printers, color copiers, and images canners enable crooks to make fakes, with relative ease, of cheques, currency, passports, visas, birth certificates, ID cards, etc.
      <br><br><b>Section 463</b> of the IPC, after amendment, defines forgery, in relation to electronic records, as the making of any false electronic record or part thereof with intent to cause damage or injury to the public or to any person, or to support any claim or title, or to cause any person to part with property, or to enter into any express or implied contract, or with intent to commit fraud or that fraud may be committed.
      <br><b>Section 466 </b>(forgery of record of Court or of Public register, etc.)<br><b>Section 468 </b>(forgery for purpose of cheating) <br><b>Section 469</b> (forger for purpose of harming reputation)<br><b>Section 470</b> (forged document or electronic record)<br><b>Section 471</b> (using as genuine a forged document).
      <h4>REAL TIME CASE STUDY</h4>
      <p>Fifty years ago, infamous criminal forger Frank Abagnale stole millions of dollars using forged personal and payroll checks. After serving five years in prison, he was recruited to help the FBI catch fraudsters like himself. He later became the subject of Ron Howard's film "Catch Me If You Can."

        <br><br>Abagnale told an interviewer for AARP that it is a thousand times easier to pass bad checks and adopt false identities today than when he began his life of crime. He advised readers to a) shred everything, b) use a credit monitoring service that will notify you if someone is trying to use your credit, and c) don't write many checks. It's too easy to create bogus checks to draw from someone else's account.</p>
    </p> 
    <h4>PRECAUTIONS</h4>
    <p>1. Learning not to store things like birthdays, credit card numbers, and bank accounts on a computer is a very important step.<br>
       2. Collecting mail as it arrives is an equally important habit, since criminals can use one area of information to obtain many others.<br>
      3. Using unique passwords and pin numbers is also a great way to prevent forgery because it limits a criminal's access to your life.<br>
         4. Also being especially careful inside banks and while conducting credit card transactions is another practice to reduce forgery attempts.</p>

  <div id="CYBER DEFAMATION/CYBER BULLYING" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>CYBER DEFAMATION/ CYBER BULLYING</h3>
    <p>A form of harassment or bullying inflicted through the use of electronic or communication devices such as computers, mobile phones, laptops, etc.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="CYBER STALKING" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>CYBER STALKING</h3>
    <p>Cyberstalking refers to the use of the internet and other technologies to harass or stalk another person online, and is potentially a crime in the United States.

  </p>
  </div>
  
  <div id="EMAIL BOMBING" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>EMAIL BOMBING</h3>
    <p>An email bomb is a form of Internet abuse which is perpetrated through the sending of massive volumes of email to a specific email address with the goal of overflowing the mailbox and overwhelming the mail server hosting the address, making it into some form of denial of service attack.

      <br>An email bomb is also known as a letter bomb.</p> 
      <h4>WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET EMAIL BOMBED</h4>
      <p>If you suddenly start receiving an endless stream of junk email to your UBC email address, perhaps asking for confirmation of a subscription, you may be the victim of an email bombing attack.
        <br>If you or someone you know is being attacked, contact UBC Cybersecurity immediately at security@ubc.ca. The Cybersecurity team will determine a plan to secure your account.
      </p>
      <h4>REAL TIME CASE STUDY</h4>
      <p>In one case, a foreigner who had been residing in Simla, India for almost thirty years wanted to avail of a scheme introduced by the Simla Housing Board to buy land at lower rates. When he made an application it was rejected on the grounds that the scheme was available only for citizens of India. He decided to take his revenge. Consequently he sent thousands of mails to the Simla Housing Board and repeatedly kept sending e-mails till their servers crashed.</p>
      <h4>PRECAUTIONS</h4>
      <p>1. Secure your online accounts with strong passphrases and avoid reusing passwords from another account that you have created.
        <br>2. Check your credit card and bank statements regularly to make sure no fraudulent charges have been made to your account.
        <br>3. Enable multi-factor authentication by setting up your Enhanced CWL and discovering how to use the Duo Mobile app for other accounts and applications
      </p>
  </div>
  
  <div id="DATA DIDDLING" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>DATA DIDDLING</h3>
    <p>Data Diddling is unauthorised altering of data before or during entry into a computer system, and then changing it back after processing is done. Using this technique, the attacker may modify the expected output and is difficult to track. In other words, the original information to be entered is changed, either by a person typing in the data, a virus that’s programmed to change the data, the programmer of the database or application, or anyone else involved in the process of creating, recording, encoding, examining, checking, converting or transmitting data.
      <br><br>This is one of the simplest methods of committing a computer-related crime, because even a computer amateur can do it. Despite this being an effortless task, it can have detrimental effects. For example, a person responsible for accounting may change data about themselves or a friend or relative showing that they’re paid in full. By altering or failing to enter the information, they’re able to steal from the enterprise. Other examples include forging or counterfeiting documents and exchanging valid computer tapes or cards with prepared replacements. Electricity boards in India have been victims of data diddling by computer criminals when private parties were computerizing their systems.
    </p>
    <h4>REAL TIME CASE STUDY</h4>
    <p>NDMC Electricity Billing Fraud Case: A private contractor who was to deal with receipt and accounting of electricity bills by the NDMC, Delhi. Collection of money, computerised, accounting record maintenance and remittance in his bank who misappropriated huge amounts of funds by manipulating data files to less receipt and bank remittance.</p>
    <h4>LAWS FOR DATA DIDDLING</h4>
    <p>Section <b>66</b> and <b>43(d)</b> of the I.T. Act covers the offence of Data Diddling.
      <br>Penalty: Not increasing 1 Crore</p>
    <h4>PRECAUTIONS</h4>
    <p>
      1. Evaluate the Risk of Third Parties<br>
      2. Monitor all Network Access <br>3. Identify All Sensitive Data <br>4. Secure All Endpoints<br> 5. Encrypt All Data <br>6. Evaluate All Permissions
    </p>

  </div>
  <div id="TROJAN ATTACKS" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>TROJAN ATTACKS</h3>
      <p>A Trojan Horse Virus is a type of malware that downloads onto a computer disguised as a legitimate program. The delivery method typically sees an attacker use social engineering to hide malicious code within legitimate software to try and gain users' system access with their software.

        A simple way to answer the question "what is Trojan" is it is a type of malware that typically gets hidden as an attachment in an email or a free-to-download file, then transfers onto the user’s device. Once downloaded, the malicious code will execute the task the attacker designed it for, such as gain backdoor access to corporate systems, spy on users’ online activity, or steal sensitive data.
        
        Indications of a Trojan being active on a device include unusual activity such as computer settings being changed unexpectedly.</p>
        <h4>HOW TO RECOGNIZE A TROJAN VIRUS</h4>
        <p>A Trojan horse virus can often remain on a device for months without the user knowing their computer has been infected. However, telltale signs of the presence of a Trojan include computer settings suddenly changing, a loss in computer performance, or unusual activity taking place. The best way to recognize a Trojan is to search a device using a Trojan scanner or malware-removal software.</p>
        <h4>EXAMPLES OF TROJAN VIRUS ATTACKS </h4>
        <p>
          Trojan attacks have been responsible for causing major damage by infecting computers and stealing user data. Well-known examples of Trojans include:
          <br><b>1. Rakhni Trojan:</b> The Rakhni Trojan delivers ransomware or a cryptojacker tool—which enables an attacker to use a device to mine cryptocurrency—to infect devices. 
          <br><b>2. Tiny Banker:</b> Tiny Banker enables hackers to steal users’ financial details. It was discovered when it infected at least 20 U.S. banks.
          <br><b>3. Zeus or Zbot:</b> Zeus is a toolkit that targets financial services and enables hackers to build their own Trojan malware. The source code uses techniques like form grabbing and keystroke logging to steal user credentials and financial details. 
          <br><b>4. Backdoor Trojan:</b> A backdoor Trojan enables an attacker to gain remote access to a computer and take control of it using a backdoor. This enables the malicious actor to do whatever they want on the device, such as deleting files, rebooting the computer, stealing data, or uploading malware. A backdoor Trojan is frequently used to create a botnet through a network of zombie computers.
          <br><b>5. Fake antivirus Trojan:</b>A fake antivirus Trojan simulates the actions of legitimate antivirus software. The Trojan is designed to detect and remove threats like a regular antivirus program, then extort money from users for removing threats that may be nonexistent.

        </p>
      <h4>PRECAUTIONS</h4>
      <p>1. Never download or install software from a source you don’t trust completely.
        <br>2. Never open an attachment or run a program sent to you in an email from someone you don’t know. 
        <br>3. Keep all software on your computer up to date with the latest patches<br>4. Make sure a Trojan antivirus is installed and running on your computer
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="IDENTITY THEFT" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>IDENTITY THEFT</h3>
      <p>Identity thieves usually obtain personal information such as passwords, ID numbers, credit card numbers or social security numbers, and misuse them to act fraudulently in the victim’s name. These sensitive details can be used for various illegal purposes including applying for loans, making online purchases, or accessing victim’s medical and financial data.
      </p>
      <h4>REAL TIME CASE STUDY</h4>
      <P>In 2015 the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) released a report on identity theft; in the previous year almost 1.1 million Americans had their identities fraudulently used to open bank, credit card, or utility accounts. The report also stated that another 16.4 million Americans were victimized by account theft, such as use of stolen credit cards and automatic teller machine (ATM) cards. The BJS report showed that while the total number of identity theft victims in the United States had grown by about 1 million since 2012, the total loss incurred by individuals had declined since 2012 by about $10 billion to $15.4 billion. Most of that decline was from a sharp drop in the number of people losing more than $2,000. Most identity theft involved small sums, with losses less than $300 accounting for 54 percent of the total.</P>
      <h4>PRECAUTIONS</h4>
      <p>
        1. Secure your connection<br> 2. Keep your devices secure <br>3. Stay away from suspicious messages and sites <br>4. Maintain good password hygiene<br>
        5. Monitor your bank and credit accounts<br> 6. Never reuse any password for multiple accounts or services<br> 7. Be careful with sensitive data<br>
        8. Don’t overshare

    <div id="PHISHING" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>PHISHING</h3>
      <p>Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent (e.g., spoofed, fake, 
        or otherwise deceptive) message designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim's infrastructure like ransomware. Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and often transparently mirror the site being targeted, allowing the attacker to observe everything while the victim is navigating the site, and transverse any additional security boundaries with the victim. As of 2020, phishing is by far the most common attack performed by cybercriminals,
         the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Centre recording over twice as many incidents of phishing than any other type of computer crime.</p>
         <h4>REAL TIME CASE STUDY</h4>
         <p>Though this incident happened sometime in 2014, it has tremendous significance because it is one of the classic email examples of the CEO Fraud category. CEO fraud is a cyber-attack carried out by malicious actors wherein they send phishing emails to the organization’s employees by posing as the organization’s CEO.<br><br>

          In this case, cyber adversaries pretending to be the organization’s CEO emailed the Accounts Payable Coordinator at Upsher-Smith Laboratories, a Maple Grove-based drug establishment, to follow the instructions from the CEO and the organization’s lawyer. The instructions were to make nine wire transfers to the fraudster’s accounts for amounts exceeding $50 million. Though the organization managed to stop one of the bank transfers, its loss was upwards of $39 million.</p>
          <h4>PRECAUTIONS</h4>
          <p>1. Don’t click on that link <br>2. Get free anti-phishing add-ons <br>3. Don’t give your information to an unsecured site <br>4. Rotate passwords regularly
            <br>5. Don’t ignore those updates<br> 6. Install firewalls<br> 7. Don’t be tempted by those pop-ups<br> 8. Have a Data Security Platform to spot signs of an attack

    <div id="VISHING" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>VISHING</h3>
        <p>During a vishing phone call, a scammer uses social engineering to get you to share personal information and financial details, such as account numbers and passwords. The scammer might say your account has been compromised, claim to represent your bank or law enforcement, or offer to help you install software. Warning: It's probably malware.
          <br><br>Vishing is just one form of phishing, which is any type of message — such as an email, text, phone call or direct-chat message — that appears to be from a trusted source, but isn’t. The goal is to steal someone's identity or money.
          <br><br>It’s getting easier to contact more people, too. Scammers can place hundreds of calls at a time using voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technology and can spoof the caller ID to make the call appear to come from a trusted source, such as your bank.
        </p>
        <h4>PRECAUTIONS</h4>
        <p>
          1. <b>Join the National Do Not Call Registry. </b>Adding your home or mobile phone number to this registry is free and tells telemarketers you don't want their phone calls. However, certain types of organizations may still call you, such as charities and political groups, and it won't stop people from illegally calling your number.
          <br>
          2. <b>Don't pick up the phone.</b>Although it may be tempting to answer every phone call, simply let them go to voicemail. Caller IDs can be faked, which means you might not know who's calling. Listen to your messages and decide whether to call the person back.
          <br>
          3. <b>Hang up. </b>The moment you suspect it's a vishing phone call, don't feel obliged to carry on a polite conversation. Simply hang up, and block the number.
          <br>4. <b>Don't press buttons or respond to prompts.</b>If you get an automated message that asks you to press buttons or respond to questions, don't do it. For instance, the message might say "Press 2 to be removed from our list" or "Say ‘yes’ to talk with an operator." Scammers often use these tricks to identify potential targets for more robocalls. They also might record your voice and later use it when navigating voice-automated phone menus tied to your accounts.
          <br>5. <b>Verify the caller's identity. </b> If the person provides a call-back number, it may be part of the scam — so don't use it. Instead, search for the company's official public phone number and call the organization in question.

        <p>Cyber pornography means an act by using cyberspace to create, display, distribute, import, or publish obscene materials, especially materials related to children who are engaged in sexual acts with adults. Pornography is a criminal offence which has been considered as one of the corrupt demonstration causing harm to people.  There are distinctive destinations which demonstrates diverse obscene material as pictures and short energized films, to sound records and stories, clients utilize the internet to make sex, sexual life, sexual acts and to orchestrate sexual exercises from computer screen. 
          <br><br>Cyber space is an instrument for Cyber pornographers who for their enjoyment disseminate and distribute or sell their products to paedophiles, thus paedophiles visit online chat room in an attempt to engage innocent children into spot for sexual activities. This alone constitutes as an offence for the act of luring a child into situation of sex, thus such acts are prohibited.

        <h4>REAL TIME CASE STUDY</h4>
        <p>The Delhi Public School is the hot issue in succession with the dirty clips of Miss. Jammu.11th standard student while having the oral sex recorded the clip of approximately 2.30 minutes by his mobile and circulated amongst his friends. The students were expelled from the school and two big arrests were also made in the same conjunction. Some more Indian incidents revolving around cyber pornography include the Air Force Balbharati School case. In the first case of this kind, the Delhi Police Cyber Crime Cell registered a case under section 67 of the IT act, 2000. A student of the Air Force Balbharati School, New Delhi, was teased by all his classmates for having a pockmarked face.

          <br><br>He decided to get back. He created a website at the URL www.amazing-gents.8m.net. The website was hosted by him on free web space. It was dedicated to Air Force Bal Bharti School and contained text material. On this site, lucid, explicit,sexual details were given about various “sexy” girls and teachers of the school. Girls and teachers were also classified on the basis of their physical attributes and perceived sexual preferences. The website also became an adult boys’ joke amongst students.
          
          <br><br>This continued for sometime till one day, one of the boys told a girl, “featured” on the site, about it. The father of the girl, being an Air Force officer, registered a case under section 67 of the IT Act, 2000 with the Delhi Police Cyber Crime Cell.
          
          <br><br>The police picked up the concerned student and kept him at Timarpur (Delhi) juvenile home. It was almost after one week that the juvenile board granted bail to the 16- year-old student.</p>
        <h4>PRECAUTIONS</h4>

      <div id="SALAMI ATTACKS" class="tabcontent">
          <h3>SALAMI ATTACKS</h3>
          <p>A “salami slicing attack” or “salami fraud” is a technique by which cyber-criminals steal money or resources a bit at a time so that there’s no noticeable difference in overall size. The perpetrator gets away with these little pieces from a large number of resources and thus accumulates a considerable amount over a period of time. The essence of this method is the failure to detect the misappropriation. The most classic approach is “collect-the-roundoff” technique. Most calculations are carried out in a particular currency are rounded off up to the nearest number about half the time and down the rest of the time. If a programmer decides to collect these excess fractions of rupees to a separate account, no net loss to the system seems apparent. This is done by carefully transferring the funds into the perpetrator’s account.
            <br><br>Attackers insert a program into the system to automatically carry out the task. Logic bombs may also be employed by unsatisfied greedy employees who exploit their know-how of the network and/or privileged access to the system. In this technique, the criminal programs the arithmetic calculators to automatically modify data, such as in interest calculations.
            <br><br>Stealing money electronically is the most common use of the salami slicing technique, but it’s not restricted to money laundering. The salami technique can also be applied to gather little bits of information over a period of time to deduce an overall picture of an organisation. This act of distributed information gathering may be against an individual or an organisation. Data can be collected from web sites, advertisements, documents collected from trash cans, and the like, gradually building up a whole database of factual

            intelligence about the target.

          <h4>REAL TIME CASE STUDY</h4>
          <p>Amit Kumar Bhowmik, a senior High Court lawyer in Pune, lost Rs 1800 after receiving three calls from an unknown number in August 2013. He had received three blank calls from an unknown number on his cell phone. When he checked his Airtel billing account online, he discovered he was being charged Rs 600 for each call.

            Bhowmik, fed up with the harassment, filed a complaint with the Pune police crime branch’s Cyber Crime Cell. The Cyber Crime Cell has yet to trace the location or identify the phone’s user because mobile companies’ privacy policies have posed a barrier in locating the offenders.</p>
            <h4>HOW TO PREVENT SALAMI ATTACKS</h4>
            <p>
              1. The corporation would upgrade the device to the highest degree possible to prevent an intrusion if the intruder takes advantage of some loophole.<br>
              2. Such banks should also tell consumers that they do not realize they were a part of some kind of deduction of capital. Both small or huge, banks could allow consumers to come forward and state freely that it may be a scenario for an act of fraud.
              <br>3. It is safe to ensure that the bank/website is really trustworthy and is not in the midst of an unjust and dishonest history.

            <h4>PRECAUTIONS</h4>
            <p>1. Keep your computer up to date by manually updating Windows or letting it install automatic updates. <br>
              2. Use some kind of antivirus or anti-malware software. You can use the virus and thread protection built into Windows or employ more comprehensive third-party antivirus apps. 
              <br>3. Be careful when you click links and open attachments. The same advice always applies when it comes to malware: Never click or open anything you do not trust, whether it's in an email or on a website. <br>

        <div id="LOGIC BOMBS" class="tabcontent">
          <h3>LOGIC BOMBS</h3>
          <p>A logic bomb, also known as “slag code”, is a malicious piece of code which is intentionally inserted into software to execute a malicious task when triggered by a specific event. It’s not a virus, although it usually behaves in a similar manner. It is stealthily inserted into the program where it lies dormant until specified conditions are met. Malicious software such as viruses and worms often contain logic bombs which are triggered at a specific payload or at a predefined time. The payload of a logic bomb is unknown to the user of the software, and the task that it executes unwanted. Program codes that are scheduled to execute at a particular time are known as “time-bombs”. For example, the infamous “Friday the 13th” virus which attacked the host systems only on specific dates; it “exploded” (duplicated itself) every Friday that happened to be the thirteenth of a month, thus causing system slowdowns.
            <br><br>Logic bombs are usually employed by disgruntled employees working in the IT sector. You may have heard of “disgruntled employee syndrome” wherein angry employees who’ve been fired use logic bombs to delete the databases of their employers, stultify the network for a while or even do insider trading. Triggers associated with the execution of logic bombs can be a specific date and time, a missing entry from a database or not putting in a command at the usual time, meaning the person doesn’t work there anymore. Most logic bombs stay only in the network they were employed in. So in most cases, they’re an insider job. This makes them easier to design and execute than a virus. It doesn’t need to replicate; which is a more complex job. To keep your network protected from the logic bombs, you need constant monitoring of the data and efficient anti-virus software on each of the computers in the network.
            <br><br>There’s another use for the type of action carried out in a logic bomb “explosion” – to make restricted software trials. The embedded piece of code destroys the software after a defined period of time or renders it unusable until the user pays for its further use. Although this piece of code uses the same technique as a logic bomb, it has a non-destructive, non-malicious and user-transparent use, and is not typically referred to as one.

        <div id="WEB JACKING" class="tabcontent">
          <h3>WEB JACKING</h3>
          <p>Web jacking derives its name from “hijacking”. Here, the hacker takes control of a web site fraudulently. He may change the content of the original site or even redirect the user to another fake similar looking page controlled by him. The owner of the web site has no more control and the attacker may use the web site for his own selfish interests. Cases have been reported where the attacker has asked for ransom, and even posted obscene material on the site.
            <br><br>The web jacking method attack may be used to create a clone of the web site, and present the victim with the new link saying that the site has moved. Unlike usual phishing methods, when you hover your cursor over the link provided, the URL presented will be the original one, and not the attacker’s site. But when you click on the new link, it opens and is quickly replaced with the malicious web server. The name on the address bar will be slightly different from the original website that can trick the user into thinking it’s a legitimate site. For example, “gmail” may direct you to “gmai1”. Notice the one in place of ‘L’. It can be easily overlooked.
            <br><br>Web jacking can also be done by sending a counterfeit message to the registrar controlling the domain name registration, under a false identity asking him to connect a domain name to the webjacker’s IP address, thus sending unsuspecting consumers who enter that particular domain name to a website controlled by the webjacker. The purpose of this attack is to try to harvest the credentials, usernames, passwords and account numbers of users by using a fake web page with a valid link which opens when the user is redirected to it after opening the legitimate site.

          <h4>REAL TIME CASE STUDY</h4>
        <p>In a recent incident reported in the USA the owner of a hobby website for children received an e-mail informing her that a group of hackers had gained control over her website. They demanded a ransom of 1 million dollars from her. The owner, a schoolteacher, did not take the threat seriously. She felt that it was just a scare tactic and ignored the e-mail. It was three days later that she came to know, following many telephone calls from all over the country, that the hackers had web jacked her website. Subsequently, they had altered a portion of the website which was entitled ‘How to have fun with goldfish’. In all the places where it had been mentioned, they had replaced the word ‘goldfish’ with the word ‘piranhas’. Piranhas are tiny but extremely dangerous flesh-eating fish. Many children had visited the popular website and had believed what the contents of the website suggested. These unfortunate children followed the instructions, tried to play with piranhas, which they bought from pet shops, and were very seriously injured!</p>

            <h3>DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK</h3>
            <p>A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an explicit attempt by attackers to deny service to intended users of that service. It involves flooding a computer resource with more requests than it can handle consuming its available bandwidth which results in server overload. This causes the resource (e.g. a web server) to crash or slow down significantly so that no one can access it. Using this technique, the attacker can render a web site inoperable by sending massive amounts of traffic to the targeted site. A site may temporarily malfunction or crash completely, in any case resulting in inability of the system to communicate adequately. DoS attacks violate the acceptable use policies of virtually all internet service providers.
              <br><br>Another variation to a denial-of-service attack is known as a “Distributed Denial of Service” (DDoS) attack wherein a number of geographically widespread perpetrators flood the network traffic. Denial-of-Service attacks typically target high profile web site servers belonging to banks and credit card payment gateways. Websites of companies such as Amazon, CNN, Yahoo, Twitter and eBay! are not spared either.

            <p>On October 16, 2020, Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) posted a blog update concerning how the threats and threat actors are changing their tactics due to the 2020 U.S. election. At the end of the post, the company snuck in a note:

              <br><br>in 2020, our Security Reliability Engineering team measured a record-breaking UDP amplification attack sourced out of several Chinese ISPs (ASNs 4134, 4837, 58453, and 9394), which remains the largest bandwidth attack of which we are aware.
              
              <br><br>Mounted from three Chinese ISPs, the attack on thousands of Google’s IP addresses lasted for six months and peaked at a breath-taking 2.5Tbps! Damian Menscher, a Security Reliability Engineer at Google, wrote:
              
              <br><br>The attacker used several networks to spoof 167 Mpps (millions of packets per second) to 180,000 exposed CLDAP, DNS, and SMTP servers, which would then send large responses to us. This demonstrates the volumes a well-resourced attacker can achieve: This was four times larger than the record-breaking 623 Gbps attack from the Mirai botnet a year earlier.</p>
